In NumberList, there's a method that exists just for testing purposes - I'm not a fan of this

Suggested changes:
	Replace with Equals() method
	{ 
		- Reduces visibility of object properties
		- Feels like it could be more clutter than just having the getter
	}
	Use a factory to build the class - perform assertions on the factory being called
	{
		- Adds another class specifically for building the object
	}
